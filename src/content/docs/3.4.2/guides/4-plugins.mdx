## Creating Plugins

Shoukaku has now official supports for plugins. However, implementing this is up to the developers that is interested on doing it

Shoukaku support modification on Rest.ts and Player.ts

To apply your plugin, put the extended classes on **ShoukakuOptions.structures**.

```js
const { Client } = require('discord.js');
const { Shoukaku, Rest, Connectors } = require('shoukaku');
class CustomRest extends Rest { }; // extended structure of your choice
const Nodes = [{
    name: 'Localhost',
    url: 'localhost:6969',
    auth: 'marin_kitagawa'
}];
const ShoukakuOptions = { structures: { rest: CustomRest } } // pass the custom structure to Shoukaku
const client = new Client();
const shoukaku = new Shoukaku(new Connectors.DiscordJS(client), Nodes, ShoukakuOptions);
```
