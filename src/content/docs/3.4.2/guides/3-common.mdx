## Search and Join a Channel

Get a Lavalink [node](/3.4.2/api/classes/node/) that you are connected to, which was [specified](/3.4.2/api/classes/shoukaku#parameters) when creating the [Shoukaku](/3.4.2/api/classes/shoukaku) instance.

```js
const node = shoukaku.getNode();
if (!node) return;
```

Search for a track, here we are searching via [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com), using the `scsearch:` prefix. The string after the prefix is the search query.

```js
const result = await node.rest.resolve('scsearch:snowhalation');
if (!result?.tracks.length) return; // no tracks
const metadata = result.tracks.shift(); // get the first trackl
```

Tell the Lavalink node to join a Discord voice channel.

```js
const player = await node.joinChannel({
    guildId: 'your_guild_id',
    channelId: 'your_channel_id',
    shardId: 0 // if unsharded it will always be zero (depending on your library implementation)
});
// player is created and ready, do your thing
```

## Play Track and change Playback Option

Here we are changing the volume, you can do [other stuff](/3.4.2/api/classes/player#methods) as well.

```js
player
    .playTrack({ track: metadata.track })
    .setVolume(0.5);
```
