## Join a voice channel, search for a track, play the track, then disconnect after 30 seconds

<Steps>
1. Tell Lavalink to join a Discord voice channel.
    
    ```js
    const player = await shoukaku.joinVoiceChannel({
    guildId: "your_guild_id",
    channelId: "your_channel_id",
    shardId: 0, // if unsharded it will always be zero (depending on your library implementation)
    });
    ```
2. Search for a track, here we are searching via [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com), using the `scsearch:` prefix. The string after the prefix is the search query.
    
    ```js
    const result = await player.node.rest.resolve("scsearch:snowhalation");
    if (!result?.tracks.length) return;
    const metadata = result.tracks.shift();
    ```
3. Tell Lavalink to play the searched track.
   
    ```js
    await player.playTrack({ track: metadata.encoded });
    ```
4. After 30 seconds, tell Lavalink to leave the voice channel.
    
    ```js
    setTimeout(() => shoukaku.leaveVoiceChannel(player.guildId), 30000).unref();
    ```
</Steps>

## Playing a track and changing a playback option
Here we are changing the volume, you can do [other stuff](/api/classes/player#methods) as well.
```js
await player.playTrack({ track: metadata.encoded });
await player.setGlobalVolume(50);
```

You can also update the player without using helper functions
```js
await player.update({ ...playerOptions });
```

## Custom function to get the ideal node
When executing any action, an API endpoint is called on a Lavalink node. When there are many nodes passed in the configuration, some logic is used to select the node to perform actions on.
```js
const shoukaku = new Shoukaku(
  new Connectors.DiscordJS(client),
  [{ ...yourNodeOptions }],
  {
    ...yourShoukakuOptions,
    nodeResolver: (nodes, connection) => getYourIdealNode(nodes, connection),
  }
);

const player = await shoukaku.joinVoiceChannel({
  guildId: "your_guild_id",
  channelId: "your_channel_id",
  shardId: 0,
});
```
